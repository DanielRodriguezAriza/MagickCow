            # Normally, when a parent relationship is set up, if the parent has already had an object transformation applied, the child does not immediately inherit that.
            # Instead, it only picks up subsequent changes to the parentâ€™s object transformation. What happens is that, at the time the parent relationship is set up, the inverse of the current parent
            # object transformation is calculated and henceforth applied before passing the parent transformation onto the child.
            # This cancels out the initial transformation, leaving the child where it is to start with.
            # This inverse is not recomputed when the parent object is subsequently moved or subject to other object transformations, so the child follows along thereafter.
            # The "Clear Parent Inverse" function sets this inverse transformation to the identity transformation, so the child picks up the full parent object transformation.
